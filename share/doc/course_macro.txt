Hi! This time I'll tell you about
macros - they are useful for organizing
large projects!
ÿ
You can do this with right-click
menus, but I'll show you the shortcuts.
Let's get started!
|||
Let's say you have a group of modules
that you want to group together into a
macro - first you need to create the
macro.
ÿ
Alt+Left-click anywhere and a macro should
pop up.
Alt+Right-click to open/close it (can also
be done via menu)
|||
Ok, now we should move the modules into
the macro. Select all of them - either
one by one with Ctrl+Leftclick on them -
or by holding Ctrl and dragging a selection
box around them.
ÿ
Now hold Ctrl+Shift and left-drag one of
the modules into the macro. When you release
the mouse, the modules should be inside the
macro! Verify by Alt+Right-clicking to
close it.
Any connections (to screen for instance) will
be routed through an "alias".
|||
If you want to move stuff out of a macro, do the
same - Ctrl+Shift-drag.
ÿ
Now that we have the macro, now what?
Well, you can save the macro for future use in
other of your projects. Right-click it
and select "save macro..." and it'll be part
of the macros selection in the module browser/list.
|||
However in order to not have to go into the macro
to tweak stuff, we need to publish parameters to
the outside through aliases.
ÿ
This is done by starting dragging out a
connection only for a bit and then just
releasing while the mouse
is still over the macro. Try it!
|||
Now that we have a functioning macro,
we can also make copies of it.
Make sure the macro is closed and
hold Alt+Ctrl and drag-release left
mouse button to create a copy!
Quite useful right?
ÿ
Also you can nest macros in macros if you
need to, a closed macro should behave just
like any other module! So Ctrl+Shift-drag
a macro into a macro to get the full use
of this feature!
|||
If you need to change the transparency of
a macro, just hold Alt and roll on your
mouse wheel. Very useful when editing
stuff using the "performance mode"!
