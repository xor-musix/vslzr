Hi! This time I'll tell you about
the performance mode in VSXu.
ÿ
It's also one of the things that make
a real-time user interface so appealing.
|||
It's very simple, once you have something
running in the preview window, hit
Ctrl+F to go fullscreen,
then hit Alt+F to enter the performance
mode. Like this you can see the result
of your actions fullscreen with the GUI
superimposed on top.
ÿ
Most useful when being creative!
